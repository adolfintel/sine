### To build the SINE.app package:
- make sure to have the Oracle JDK 1.7 installed
- run the `bundleapp` and `bundleeditor` scripts both with the `-r` arg
- if the script can't find your JDK path, edit the first two variables in the script accordingly
- move the apps from the `SINE` folder to the Application folder

If you want to use your system JDK, run the scripts without the `-r` arg

You don't have to build both of the apps if you don't want it.
